I am currently a 2nd year ece student at the university of santo tomas. I am interested in electronics, robotics, video making, UX and in creating ideas that could help other people's lives. I was a part of the team that represented the Philippines in the 2018 NASA space apps. In the future, I aim to become someone that makes other people's lives easier.
